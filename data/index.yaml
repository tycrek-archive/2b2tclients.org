      One of the most common clients used on 2b2t. Great for new players due to ease of use. Includes built-in Baritone, an AI pathfinder bot that can automatically escape spawn. It was made well known during the Rusher War after Rusher's advertisement and through eventual use of many 2b2t YouTubers. Impact has many modules that are useful on 2b2t for explorers, travelers, and builders.
    pros:
      - Easy to use
      - Built-in Baritone
    cons:
      - Nothing special that isn't found in other clients
      - No decent movement modules
